Building:
Install the build tools,
$sudo yum install rpm-build rpmdevtools

sets up an RPM build area in your ~/rpmbuild directory. This directory will contain several subdirectories, for the project source code, RPM configuration files and for the resulting source and binary packages. 

$ rpmdev-setuptree
if fails,
mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{BUILD,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}

cd masakari
tar czvf masakari-processmonitor.tar.gz masakari-processmonitor --exclude='masakari-processmonitor/debian' --exclude='masakari-processmonitor/rpmbuild'
mv masakari-processmonitor.tar.gz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/
cp masakari-processmonitor/rpmbuild/SPECS/processmonitor.spec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/
cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/
rpmbuild --bb hostmonitor.spec

rpms are in,
cd ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/ARCH
